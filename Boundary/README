This folder contains the filter to take an airway, the nostril plane, and the
trachea chorina plane and produce the boundary conditions for the Laplace
equation. This Will be used to segment the airways into iso-therms that and then
cross-sections for the pediatric airways project. The specifics for this filter
are listed below.


Goal: produce ITK filter that creates a boundary condition image suitable for the 
itkLaplaceEquationSolverImageFilter

Input:
	* Binary image where non-zero value marks a segmented object, such as an airway, 
		and zero value marks background
	* Definition of plane used to mark the nostrils
	* Definition of plane used to mark bottom plane of the airway

Output: 
	* Image containing boundary condition labels
	* Solution index: 11 (interior of airway)
	* Nostril boundary condition: 5
	* Trachea carina boundary condition :4
	* Neumann boundary condition (sides of airway) : 6

If you want to make the CLI plugin for Slicer you need to edit the AirwayLaplaceBoundaryFilter.cxx file.
The final #include declaration needs to refrence the location where you build the the plugin.
